*) Demo:
  events {

  }

  http {
          include mime.types;

          server{
                  listen 80;
                  server_name 34.68.170.207;

                  root /app/;
                  
                  # condition
                  if ( $arg_name = 'roman-ojha' ){
                          # here we are checking for argument 'name' and if the argument 'name' value is 'roman-ojha' then it will return the message with status code
                          # now in any path with given args 'name' have the value 'roman-ojha' the we will return bellow line
                          return 200 "Hello roman ojha";
                  }

                  location /find {
                          return 200 "$hostname \n $args \n $connection_requests \n $nginx_version";
                          # we will return the string from this context where we will use all the default variable that is provided by nginx
                  }
          }

  }
  -> Now if we will go to '/find?name=roman-ojha' then 'name=roman-ojha' is the args
