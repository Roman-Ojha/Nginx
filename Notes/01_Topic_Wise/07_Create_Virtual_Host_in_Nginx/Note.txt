  -> Inside './project' we have include the project which is a static content project
  -> We will now upload this './project/' folder into the VPS machine:
    -> scp <path_where_file_exist> <user_name_of_server>@<ip_address_of_server>:<path_where_you_want_to_upload_given_folder_and_files>
      -> (Upload file)
      -> (NOTE try to upload on user directory folder '~' because in other you might will get permission deined)
    -> scp -r <path_where_folder_exist> <user_name_of_server>@<ip_address_of_server>:<path_where_you_want_to_upload_given_folder_and_files>
      -> (Upload Folder)
    -> scp -r -i <path_to_ssh_key> <path_where_folder_exist> <user_name_of_server>@<ip_address_of_server>:<path_where_you_want_to_upload_given_folder_and_files>

  -> Now we will do configuration of Nginx:
    -> cd /etc/nginx
    -> First we will backup the default configuration file:
      -> mv nginx.conf nginx_backup.conf
      -> sudo cp nginx_backup.conf nginx.conf

    -> Now we will remove everthing and put bellow code inside nginx.conf file:
        events {

        }

        http {

                server{

                }

        }

    -> Now we will configure on our own way
