*) Install Nginx as service in windows:
	-> https://youtu.be/OW9WMqo-mUw

*) Different between restart and reload command:
	-> systemctl reload nginx:
		-> reload command will referesh the configuration on your running nginx process
	-> systemctl restart nginx:
		-> It will first stop the nginx and the start it and in that case if configuration file have some error then you mignt not be able to start the nginx process which may kill you web server.
		
*) Nginx ssh certificate for https request:
	-> sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
	-> NOTE: that 80 & 443 port should be oppend by cloud provider or firewall so that we can do https or http request to the server, 80 port for http & 443 port for https request
	-> NOTE: to objtain and install the certificate you can see on 'https://github.com/geekyshow1/GeekyShowsNotes/blob/main/nginx/SSL_Cert_Nginx.md'
	-> Or to just create certificate so that you can install the certificate by yourself and configure it inside nginx by yourself in that case just create the certificate using
		-> sudo certbot certonly --nginx -d <domain> -d www.<domain>

	-> Nginx config filename: domain
	server {
        # ssl for https protocal
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name journey.uk.to www.journey.uk.to;
        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/journey.uk.to/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/journey.uk.to/privkey.pem;
        location / {

                proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }

}

server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
