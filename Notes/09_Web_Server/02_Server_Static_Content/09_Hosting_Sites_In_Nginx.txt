*) Types of Websites hosting in Nginx
    => Website hosting using domain names
    => Website hosting using IP addresses
    => Websites hosting using ports
    => Load different configuration based on location directive
    => Handling common files using pattern matching
    => Avoid regular expression matching
    => Exact modifiers
    => location context special cases - try_file, rewrite

*) test websites in :
    1) Web Url: http://razzroman1.com
        under: /APPS/website1/index.html
    2) Web Url: http://razzroman2.com
        under: /APPS/website2/index.html
    3) Web Url: http://192.168.31.250
        under: /APPS/website3/index.html
    4) Web Url: http://razzroman1.com:81
        under: /APPS/website4/index.html

    -> sudo mkdir APPS
    -> cd APPS
    -> sudo mkdir website1
        -> cd website1
        -> sudo touch index.html
        -> sudo vim index.html
            -> write (:w) and save, exist (:x) 
    -> sudo mkdir website2
        -> same as previous
    -> sudo mkdir website3
        -> same as previous
    -> sudo mkdir website4
        -> same as previous

    -> cd /etc/nginx/conf.d
    -> sudo touch ipbase.conf
    -> sudo touch portbase.conf
    -> sudo touch razzroman1.conf
    -> sudo touch razzroman2.conf
    -> NOTE: main config file: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf there we have:
        -> include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf; (it means that, if we make any file under this included directory then that will be consider by nginx)
*) Website Hosting sites in Nginx using Domain Name:
        -> sudo vim razzroman1.conf
            -> server{
                listen 80;
                server_name razzroman1.com;

                location / {
                    # location of html file
                    root /APPS/website1;
                    index index.html index.htm;
                }

                error_page  500 502 503 504 /50x.html
                location = /50x.html{
                    # if error occur then error goes to
                    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
                }
            }
    -> run the nginx server or restart it
            -> inside /nignx/nginx.conf
                -> http{
                    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
                }
            -> here it had already include all those config file in main nginx.conf

*) Website Hosting sites in Nginx using ipBase:
    -> NOTE: First look for ip that are available in you OS machine:
        -> ip addr
            -> inet <ip_address>/20 brd 172.24.255.255 scope global eth0
                -> The IP that is available in you machine put the same ip address for server_name name
        -> server{
                listen 192.168.31.250:80;
                # here on ipbase we are again listening on port 80
                server_name 192.168.31.250;
                # and also server name need to be the same ip

                location / {
                    # location of html file
                    root /APPS/website1;
                    index index.html index.htm;
                }

                error_page  500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
                location = /50x.html{
                    # if error occur then error goes to
                    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
                }
            }
