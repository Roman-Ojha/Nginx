*) Nginx Install Type:
    -> Yum Based
    -> Source code compilation with Nginx Tar ball

*) Prepare Your Ngin Testing Environment:
    => Virtualization Software
        -> VmWare Workstation
        -> Oracle VirtualBox
    => Operatinve System/ISO
        -> Centos (linux os) (http://www.centos.org/download) -> then install:
            -> Text based browser: yam install lynx
            -> Vim Editor: Yum install vim
            -> Text based downloader: yam install wget
        -> Ubuntu server (linux os) (https://ubuntu.com/download/server) -> then install:
            -> Text based browser: sudo apt-get install lynx
            -> Vim Editor: sudo apt-get install vim
            -> Text based downloader: sudo apt-get install wget


-> ubuntu server os:
    -> enpOs3 : eth
    -> DHCPv4 : 10.0.2.15/24
    
    => profile setup:
        -> name: Roman Ojha
        -> server name: romanserver
        -> pick username: razzroman
        -> password: ubuntuserver


*) Install step:
    => On Ubuntu server OS
        -> install linux server os in VM
        -> sudo poweroff (to shutdown the os)
        -> sudo apt-get install lynx
        -> sudo apt-get install vim
        -> sudo apt-get install wget
        -> sudo apt install nginx 
            -> sudo systemctl status nginx (to see the nginx status)
            -> service nginx status (to see is nginx is running or not)
            -> systemctl status nginx (to see the nginx status)
            -> nginx -v (to see the version of the nginx)
            -> service nginx start (to start the server)
            -> systemctl start nginx (to start the server)
            -> service nginx stop (to stop the server)
            -> systemctl stop nginx (to stop the server)
            -> lynx http://localhost/ (to see in the browser)
        -> ip addr (to see the os ip)
        -> sudo systemctl status firewalld
        -> systemctl stop firewalld
        -> sudo ufw app list (to get alising of the application profiles)
        -> sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP' (to allow http)
        -> sudo ufw enable (if status: inactive)
        -> sudo ufw status
        -> to access the server from the host when we are in VM
            -> to see how to do that you can search in youtube:
                -> How to access server running in VirtualBox from the host
        -> open <ip> on windows browser
    => Minimum dependencies to compile Nginx Tar ball
        -> see documentation or watch video
